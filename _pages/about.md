Hey there ðŸ‘‹! You can call me Gilberto. I'm currently a MSc. student in the Computer Science departament at ICMC in the University of Sao Paulo with emphasis on Artificial Intelligence and Time Series. I'm working as a researcher at LABIC under the supervision of prof. Diego Furtado Silva with Deep Learning methods for Time Series Classification and One-Class Learning.

I've made my BSc. degree at Federal Institute of Santa Catarina under the supervision of prof. Carlos Andres Ferrero, there I worked with an algorithm to transform brain tumor images into time series structures and then applying an unsupervised clustering algorithm to group the structures into groups and after that analysing each group.
